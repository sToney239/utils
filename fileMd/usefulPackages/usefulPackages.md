Useful Packages
================

## mix effect model

- [lme4](https://github.com/lme4/lme4) :Mixed-effects models in R
  - **negative binomial** mixed model using the Laplace approximation,
    which is known not to be optimal, so use GLMMadaptive, and use
    `GLMMadaptive::marginal_coefs()`
- [fixest](https://lrberge.github.io/fixest/reference/index.html) : Fast
  and user-friendly fixed-effects estimation
- [modelr](https://padpadpadpad.github.io/post/bootstrapping-non-linear-regressions-with-purrr/):
  modeling functions working with pipe
- [fwildclusterboot](https://s3alfisc.github.io/fwildclusterboot/):
  multiple fast wild cluster bootstrap
- [simpr](https://statisfactions.github.io/simpr/index.html): tidy
  sampling
- [gratia](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gratia/vignettes/gratia.html):
  ggplot-mgcv(GAM) visualization
- [GLMMadaptive](https://drizopoulos.github.io/GLMMadaptive/index.html):
  Generalized Linear Mixed Models
  - using the adaptive Gauss-Hermite quadrature rule
  - but only accept 1 random effect
- [inla](https://www.r-inla.org/learnmore/books)

## ggplot

- [ggsflabel](https://github.com/yutannihilation/ggsflabel) : map
  labelling
